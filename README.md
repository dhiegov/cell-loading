# Nuclear Cell Loading Routine (NCLR)

An [fCPU][1] program to wastelessly load a uranium fuel cell into a nuclear reactor from the game [Factorio][2].

## TODOs

- Explain the problem this program solves
- Write a tutorial with pictures for how to set it up
- Use the number of storage tanks to calculate the threshold at which there is space for a new fuel cell worth of steam
- Use the number of reactors to calculate how much steam the loading of one cell in each would generate
- Maybe make a demo in a gif or a short video
